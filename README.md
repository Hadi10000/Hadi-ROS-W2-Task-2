# ROS-W2-Task-2
My dealings with turtlesim.
## turtlesim in ROS neotic
turtlesim is an included package in the full ROS neotic installation. <br />
I followed the steps found here
I used 3 tabs in the Terminal to get it working <br />

in the first I executed {roscore} for ROS to be active during. <br />

the second {rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node} to run turtlesim. <br />

the last {rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key} to control turtlesim.
